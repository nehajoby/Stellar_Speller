stellar_speller_main.py - Runs both classes and corrects the spelling mistakes on the user's text file.

errors.py - The Errors class processes user input by reading the user inputted file and comparing it to the dictionary to create a list of spelling errors which must be corrected.

correct_errors.py - The CorrectErrors class corrects the incorrect misspelled words found by the Errors class. The functions in this class spell checking each given word by finding different spelling mistakes and cross-checking the corrected words with all the words in the dictionary.

dictionary.txt - The dictionary that Stellar Speller uses to compare misspelled words with the correct spelling. This text file is a list of 181,080 words from the English language which includes, but is not limited to, all plurals, suffixes, prefixes of every word. I downloaded this text file from Dr. Phillip M. Feldmanâ€™s website English Spelling Dictionaries.

sample_passage.txt - A sample user input text file that I used to make sure the program works.

corrected_passage.txt - The edited version of sample_passage.txt with correct spellings produced by Stellar Speller.
